# Brandon Yan's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain configured through Cloudflare.

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, resume, and contact information. The site is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Custom Domain Setup

I have set up a custom domain (www.brandonvyan.com) for this site using Cloudflare for DNS management. Below are the steps I followed:

1. **Cloudflare DNS Settings**:
   - **CNAME Record**: 
     - Name: `www`
     - Target: `bdonyan.github.io`
   - **A Record**:
     - Name: `@`
     - IPv4 address: `185.199.108.153`

2. **GitHub Pages Settings**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository settings.
   - Under "GitHub Pages", set the custom domain to `www.brandonyan.com`.
   - Click "Save" to update the settings.

3. **Enforce HTTPS**:
   - Ensure HTTPS is enforced once DNS settings are properly configured.
